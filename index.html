                                                The journey began the summer of 1998 when Kathryn Bolster, the founder and heart and soul of Katapult, started on a graduate degree at <a href="www.rit.edu" target="_blank">Rochester 
                            Institute of Technololgy</a> in software development. She had just graduated magna cum laude from <a href="www.naz.edu" target="_blank">Nazareth College</a> with a degree in Political Science and Pre-Law, however, had decided
                                                that pursuing a career in law did not fit with the lifestyle she had envisioned for herself. Therefore she decided to pursue a career in the exciting realm of software development.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Shortly after she started her summer course work for the graduate program she received a call from Keane, Inc.
                                                <a href="https://us.nttdata.com/en/" target="_blank">(now part of NTT Data)</a>, a company that had her resume from a job fair she had attended. They were recruiting people who excelled in math to take an
                                                aptitude test to see if they qualified to be trained in assisting with Y2K code remediation. While this wasn't exactly the cutting edge technology she was expecting to learn at RIT, it was paid for and it
                                                was a job doing programming so she took advantage of the opportunity. After acing the apptitude test she was shuttled to Boston for a 3 month intensive training program that taught her the basics of programming.
                                                Shortly after Y2K Keane invested in Kathryn for a second time and sent her to Boston for 2 months of client/server training. Here she had her first introduction to object oriented programming, database design
                                                and implementation, and concepts of how clients and servers interact. She really enjoyed this training and was thrilled to incorporate a visual aspect to her coding.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As the Y2K boom waned and Keane's opportunties dried up Kathryn went to work for a 2-man shop that specialized in custom web development. Being the third person in a company that at the time was designing and developing data-driven websites, stand alone
                                                shopping carts and working with large area businesses to develop client-server solutions for their manufacturing lines allowed her to grow her skills tremendously. PHP, Javascript, SQL Server, VB, and C++
                                                were some of the skills she honed while working there. On top of on-the-job learning she also took a graduate level course in C++ at Syracuse University. It was a right of passage the owner put on her. He
                                                knew the course was tough and wanted to put his new employee through her paces. While the course was challenging, Kathryn earned an A and learned a great deal.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The beauty of working in a tiny company is the ability to touch every aspect of every project. An employee is forced to be a jack of all trades and the learning opportunity is immense. This was the perfectly appropriate job for Kathryn to learn the skills
                                                she would need to further her career. When work was scarce and the company shifted focus Kathryn did some contract client/server programming for about a year before accepting a full time position as a programmer/anaylst
                                                for a finacial services company. At this job Kathryn did a great deal of database work with both SQL Server and Oracle. She also developed multiple applications using the Microsoft .NET framework. Kathryn
                                                also completed the Syracuse University MS .NET Application Developer Program, an intensive study of 3 focused modules that immersed you into the various nuances of the development environment, SQL Server,C#
                                                and VB.NET. From the financial services company Kathryn got a job close to home at a medical device manufacturer and worked there for a decade. During her time there she started her family and eventually
                                                went to part time. Now that her children are older and she has more time she is eager to get back into developing applications and beautiful websites. No stranger to learning on her own she has taken various
                                                classes to get up to speed on the latest technologies and tools such as HTML5/CSS, the bootstrap framework, PHP, jQuery, Javascript, mySQL, NoSQL, GIT, etc. She also has the advantage of all her experience
                                                and understanding of how things work and fit together. She has coded the things in the past that current tools now do for you and has a comprehensive understanding of what is going on beneath the hood of
                                                an application. If you're looking for someone who is flexible to take on as little or as much as you need and to do quality, diligent work in a timely manner - look no futher than Katapult Coding and Web

                                            Being a family of two adults, two kids, and
                                            <a href="http://kbolster.webhost4life.com/FullStackDeveloper/dogtribute/" target="_blank">two dogs</a> makes for a pretty active life. The Bolster's love to be outside in the nice weather as well as hunker down
                                            and get snuggle time on the couch when the weather gets cold. They enjoy spending time in the Adirondacks hiking, swimming and paddle boarding during the summer, as well as, hanging at their house and hosting
                                            lots of freinds. In the winter they spend a lot more time inside and should probably figure out a winter sport to take up.

                                            Their dogs keep the family busy bringing them to the local 'dog utopia' which is luckily right around the corner. The kids are at the perfect ages and their sweetness to independence ratio is just right. Developing a freeze ray to keep them at this stage
                                            is currently under discussion. Both kids have their separate passions that fill them up and keep the adults driving skills sharp through constant use. It's a great life and one that this family cherishes and
                                            appreciates every moment of.

                                            the site owner to track data about the users and also allowed for a more engaging user experience.
